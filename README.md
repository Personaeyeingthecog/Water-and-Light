Strangely

THere is little light in the chamber of the vertebrate convection hoze. I learnt that wrestling was one of the earliest combat sport in human history ever since developed in 700 bc Greece.

Swimming

Swimming is a beautiful art of movement. through developing the kindred relationship with water, understanding your body, feeling like that their are talking to eachother. Everytime an action is done, there is reaction from the other body. The two are the kindred spirit. The strange paradox is that the action is basicly a series of processes of wrestling against the entity of water. However what water does is more than just backing the force, it seems to help you fight itself. In so creating the propelling current that drive your command yonder. you can take a stride, promanade through the microcosmic molecule, but you can also force apart their inter-quantential gravity and create your own mark. In a way, this is the closest relation, while we are out of air, land. There is still water, water is where we were once born, and we are destined to return to it. 

Water is our home.
